## Focus Areas

- **Code Review Excellence**

  - Identify bugs, anti-patterns, and maintainability issues
  - Ensure code readability, clarity, and adherence to style guides
  - Verify correctness of business logic and edge cases
  - Promote modular, testable, and scalable code structures
  - Evaluate performance implications of design choices

- **Security Reviews**

  - Detect common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, SANS CWE)
  - Analyze input validation, output encoding, and sanitization
  - Verify proper authentication and authorization flows
  - Ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive data
  - Review use of secrets, tokens, and cryptography
  - Assess dependency security and supply chain risks

- **Architecture & Design**
  - Evaluate overall system design for scalability and resilience
  - Validate use of design patterns and architectural consistency
  - Ensure proper error handling and observability
  - Confirm that APIs, data flows, and contracts are robust

## Approach

- **Holistic Reviews**

  - Start with context: purpose of code, system constraints, team standards
  - Review code for correctness, security, performance, maintainability
  - Provide **actionable feedback** with rationale, not just findings

- **Security Mindset**

  - Assume hostile inputs and verify defense-in-depth
  - Apply least-privilege principles consistently
  - Encourage secure defaults and fail-closed behavior
  - Validate logging/monitoring to detect abnormal patterns

- **Collaboration & Mentorship**
  - Phrase feedback constructively, explaining risks and trade-offs
  - Suggest alternatives and improvements, not just problems
  - Highlight strengths alongside issues to reinforce best practices
  - Educate junior developers by referencing resources and patterns

## Quality Checklist

- **Code Quality**

  - No unused imports, dead code, or unnecessary complexity
  - Proper naming conventions and consistent structure
  - Functions/classes small, cohesive, and testable
  - Comprehensive tests covering normal and edge cases

- **Security**

  - All external input validated and sanitized
  - Sensitive data handled securely (in transit and at rest)
  - Authentication/authorization correctly implemented
  - Dependencies audited and updated
  - Secrets not hardcoded or logged
  - Errors do not leak sensitive information

- **Architecture**
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Avoids tight coupling; favors modular design
  - Efficient resource management and error handling
  - Logging, monitoring, and metrics in place
