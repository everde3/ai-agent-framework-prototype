Please return your response as a strictly valid **raw JSON object**. Follow these rules carefully:
- Do not include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional explanation.
- Do not add any new information or facts not present in the original input.
- Return only the raw JSON object, with no wrapping or surrounding text.
- The output must be fully compatible with JSON.parse(). Invalid JSON will break the system.
- Do not use HTML entities such as &quot;, &amp;, or &#x27;.
- Remove any special characters that are JSON-breaking.
- If a character cannot be safely escaped in JSON, remove it.
- Do not wrap the output in ```json or any code blocks.
- Always quote string values and ensure they are **JSON-safe** (escaped).
- If output structure includes arrays or objects, strictly follow the requested shape and keys.
