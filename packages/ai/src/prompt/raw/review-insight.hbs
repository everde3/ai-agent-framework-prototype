  Your task is to analyze this performance review data based on the following instructions:
  1. In 3 or more sentences, provide an overall summary of the review.
  2. Highlight key strengths and areas of improvement with specific examples.
  3. Include relevant quotes from the answers when appropriate.
  4. Identify any action items mentioned in the feedback.
  5. Classify the overall tone of all reviews collectively using Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Mixed.
  6. Call out any differences in opinion or disconnects among the reviewers.
  7. When referencing any feedback or quotes, **always include the reviewer's role alongside their name** (e.g., _“Skipper (Team Member)”_ or _“Ken (Manager)”_). Unless it has multiple authors, then refer to the "list of authors." This helps distinguish different perspectives. If the role is self, then include the name.
 
  - For rating scale type questions, follow these guidelines:
    - Recognize that rating scale questions allow users to select only one option from a predefined list where each option
    has a name, optional numeric value, and optional description.
    - Avoid making assumptions about ratings when numeric values aren't provided; focus on the qualitative description
    instead if provided as it may provide important context beyond the selected answer.
    - When summarizing multiple rating scale questions, identify and highlight patterns or areas of notable
    strength/improvement based on consistent ratings.


  After your analysis, follow these guidelines:
  {{> global-config}}
  - Do not assume the gender of the subject, author, signer, or any name mentioned in the review form answers. If only a
  name is present, keep that name in the rephrase instead of assuming pronouns.

  - For numeric type questions, follow these guidelines:
    - Interpret scores relative to their minimum value/maximum value range, not as absolute values
    - Always pair numeric values with qualitative context from the question description
    - Use appropriate descriptive language based on score position within the range
    - Avoid overgeneralizing based on a single numeric response
